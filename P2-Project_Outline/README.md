### Overview 
A Widow Extra Help is a dedicated community for people grieving the loss of someone they love.  A Widow Extra Help is a community committed to looking out for one another.  A Widow Extra Help provides a compassionate, trusting and non-judgemental environment.  A Widow Extra Help is here to help each other in our local communities find businesses, contractors and people we can trust. 

My husband died expectantly at the age of 35 years old.  Our daughters were 9, 5, and 2 years old at the time.  Not only was my world turned upside down and I'm trying to figure out how to navigate through life with out him.  My husband Ronnie could fix and repair anything and would help anyone in need.  He loved to make a difference in someone's life.  I created this website because my rock, my protector, my fixer is no longer here.  Oh how I dread to have to call someone to come and repair something.  I created this website so when you contact that user sourced local plumber, roofer, handyman, etc... you know they have your best interest and will not over charge you.
